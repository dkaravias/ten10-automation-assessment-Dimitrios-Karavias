# Ten10 Interest Calculator - Test Automation Framework


## Approach
My main objective was to demonstrate how a comprehensive test framework can be created in a shareable, repeatable manner using Cursor with Claude-4 sonnet. Playright's default Cursor rules combined with the 2 AI-generated prompts are used to achieve 1-shot Project Generation. <br>
I have also included the full Copilot conversation to demonstrate my thought process. <br>
### Current state
Only the first 2 Interest Calculation tests are passing. I would need 2-3 more hours to troubleshoot the locators for the remainder, as they have been inferred from the Requirements. <br>
Given more time, I also would've invested more into providing better examples to the AI to generate better prompts. This would save a lot of trial and error down the line, as having a conversation tends to produce lower-quality results compared to clear upfront specifications, ideally by example.

## 📊 Enhanced Testing Features

### Smart Element Interaction
```typescript
// Wait for element stability
await TestUtils.waitForStableElement(locator);

// Form filling with verification
await TestUtils.smartFill(inputField, value);
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
const perfStart = await TestUtils.performanceCheck(page, 'Login flow');
// ... perform actions ...
TestUtils.finishPerformanceCheck(perfStart, 'Login flow');
```

### Calculator-Specific Validation
```typescript
// Mathematical accuracy verification
await CalculatorValidation.verifyMathematicalAccuracy(principal, rate, duration, result);

// Number format validation
await CalculatorValidation.verifyNumberFormat(value, 2); // 2 decimal places
```
